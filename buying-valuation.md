When you see a potential car for sale that you like, the first thing you need to do is work out if the advertised price is accurate. We have some tips for working out a car’s value.

If the price is way off what it should be you can try negotiating, although some sellers over estimate how much they can get for their car.

Often, when a private seller lists their car, they inflate the price initially to see if they can get anyone who will buy this inflated price. Unless their car is rare, this strategy doesn’t work. You can often tell if this is the case by looking at the date the listing was created and comparing the price to other similar cars.

### Search for similar cars
Chances are, there’s a car similar in age and condition to the one you’re looking at listed on a car classifieds website. Before you go searching, there’s a few points to keep in mind:

- **Search for cars with similar mileage:** Mileage is one of the biggest factors that affects price. You might find a low-priced car of the same model as yours and start dreaming about the money you’ll save. Before you get too excited, check that it has a similar mileage. 
*The average motorist drives around 15,000 - 20,000 kilometres per year.*
- **Make sure you’re really searching for the same model car:** You might think you’re looking at a 2005 Mitsubishi Magna, but there’s about 8 different variants of 2005 Mitsubishi Magnas. Vehicle manufacturers create different ‘badges’ (not physical badges) of each model car to provide variation and choice between entry level and more sophisticated models. Car classifieds websites always list the exact make, model and badge so ensure they line up between your searches.
- **Search for cars that have similar wear and tear:** When conducting your research, pay close attention to cars that have a similar paint colour and condition, similar interior design, similar condition of the seats and upholstery, and similar condition of the wheels.
- **Search for cars with similar registration expiry dates:** It may seem like a small tweak, but with registration costing close to $1000 these days, it can make or break a few hundred dollars when you sell. Just remember to factor in registration expiry dates searching for similar cars.
