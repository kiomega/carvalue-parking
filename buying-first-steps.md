Congratulations on your decision to buy a new or used car! It’s one of the bigger decisions you’ll make in your life, so it pays to do your research before running to the closest car yard and buying the first car you see.

### How to fund the purchase
The first step towards buying a new or used car is to work out how you’re going to fund the purchase. Often, this step is an easy one, because we only have one or two options, but sometimes this can involve a bit of thinking and financial planning. Below are the most common methods of funding and their pros/cons:

- **Self funded**: Probably the easiest in terms of paperwork. If you (or your company) has the cash available to purchase the car, then you can start searching for a car straight away. There’s no hoops you need to jump through in order to secure your car. One thing you need to keep in mind is whether you might need that cash for something else in the future. Especially true for companies, where cash-flow is super important. If you (or your company’s) cash flow is tight and you spend most of it on a car, it could present problems in the future when other financial obligations come in.
- **Finance lease**: A finance lease is where a leasing company purchases the vehicle and pays for it upfront, and then leases it back to you for a fixed monthly cost. With this type of lease, you organise the car and lease yourself, without any help from your employer. Finance leases are fairly easy to get in Australia, provided you prove you can afford the monthly repayments. Some leasing companies allow you to pay a lower monthly cost, with the expectation that you’ll pay a ‘balloon’ payment at the end of the lease to purchase the vehicle from them, or trade the car in and begin a new lease with a new car. Because you’re paying a fixed monthly cost, you aren’t tying up your cash flow, however you have a legal obligation to pay the repayment amount every month, otherwise you risk defaulting and affecting your credit rating. Most leases include insurance as part of the monthly repayments.
- **Novated lease**: Similar to finance lease (above), however this arrangement involves your employer leasing the car on your behalf, and paying for the lease out of your pre-tax salary. You are still responsible for the lease, but because the repayments come out of your pre-tax salary, you can effectively have more income available after the repayment has been paid.
- **Bank loan**: With a bank loan, you organise with your bank of choice an amount of debt that you’ll repay over the course of 1 - 5 years (most common). The bank takes your car as security, so if you cannot make your repayments, the bank can take your car. Most banks will only allow you to borrow the amount for the vehicle itself, so you can’t include insurance or any other costs in the loan amount.
Most leasing company and bank websites allow you to see how much you can afford based on your salary. This is a good starting point and allows you to compare their offers. Once you have decided on a method of finance, you’ll need to either ring or visit the company/bank to organise a pre-approval amount. This allows you to shop around, knowing how much you can spend.

### How much to spend
Once you have an idea about how to finance the purchase, you’ll need to work out how much to spend. Often, working out how to finance the purchase and deciding how much to spend are a process the work together.

If you’re buying the car outright, remember to save some money for the other costs you’ll incur. Insurance, registration and servicing can all be expensive surprises, so remember to save a little for them. Similarly, if you’re financing the car via lease or bank loan, don’t get fooled by the quote calculators on leasing company/bank websites. Just because you can afford $2000 per month doesn’t mean it’s a good idea if your salary close to that amount. If you’re not sure, speak to a financial planner.

### Decide which car you’d like
Gone are the days where you go to your local dealer and see what they have available. The internet is alive and well, and allows you to shop at almost every car dealer and private seller, all in the comfort of your own home.

Car classifieds websites are the number one place to search for a new or used car. Anyone who is serious about selling will place an ad on a car classifieds website. The two biggest websites are:

- [Carsales.com.au](http://carsales.com.au)
- [Drive.com.au](http://drive.com.au)

The choices on these websites can be overwhelming, so we’ve got some tips to help you drill down:

- **Filter the price to 5% under your maximum limit:** There’s no point in looking at cars you can’t afford, but it’s also a good idea to add a buffer to your maximum price. That way, if you find a car you really like, you might be able to add on some optional extras such as window tinting.
- **Filter to your preferred transmission:** If you can’t drive a manual, then there’s no point in looking at them! Or if you prefer having the option of a semi-automatic car, then include that in your filter.
- **Filter to your state:** if you’re looking for a car by a common car manufacturer, there’s likely some in every state. Start by looking for cars in your own state, and if you can’t find any you like then consider broadening your search to other states.
- **Start with your ideal choice and work your way down:** Chances are, you’ve got a rough idea of what you’d like to buy. Start with your most-ideal make and model car, and if it’s not in your price range, lower your criteria slightly.
- **Use the sort order like it’s your best friend:** By default, the listings that appear at the top of the results are the ‘premium’ listings - listings that the advertiser has paid a little more to make appear at the top. If you’re looking for the latest model-year, then sort by the year, from highest to lowest. That way you’ll see the latest model-year cars first.
- **Include both new and used cars in your search:** Even if you’re looking for a new car, it’s beneficial to include used cars as some may take your interest. You can save a lot by buying ex-demo cars.
