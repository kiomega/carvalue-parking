Let us help you avoid these common mistakes so you can maximise your resale value of your car.

### Car Classifieds Scams
If you’ve just listed your car on a classifieds website and get a enquiry straight away, chances are it’s a scam. Unless your car is in super hot demand (and not a lot are), it’s likely to be a scam.

Be wary of people wanting to send you money through wire-transfer services or via bank transfer.

The safest way to receive payment for your car is via bank cheque. A bank cheque is guaranteed to have the money available when you deposit the cheque, so there’s no chance of bounced cheques.

### Setting the price at exactly what you want to receive
Set the price of the car about 5% - 10% above your ideal sell price. Private car purchasers want to feel like they got a good deal, so they will always negotiate. Allow for this by adding a buffer to your price, so you can easily go down.

### Accepting a lower price straight away
A commonly known practice in sales is to never give to a lower offer straight away. If a buyer offers you a lower price, say you’ll think about it and get back to them. Even if the price is within your buffer (see above point), still don’t accept it straight away.

Giving in to a lower price straight away is a sign of weakness and may prompt the buyer to expect to be able to get more shaved off the price.

### Expecting non-common optional extras to increase the value
Things like alloy-wheels, a sunroof and a spoiler are likely to increase your car’s resale value. But non common upgrades, such as a louder exhaust, or an ECU (engine control unit) upgrade are unlikely to increase the car’s value.

### Handing over your keys for a test drive
When a potential buyer meets with you for a test drive, make sure they’re legitimate before handing over your keys. Ideally, they want to take the car for a drive themselves, as they will feel more comfortable without you next to them. If you’re comfortable with this, there’s a few steps you’ll need to take before handing over the keys.

If they drove to meet with you, take their keys while they’re in your car. Also, take a photo of their driver’s license, so if anything goes wrong, you have their details. If you’re not comfortable with them driving your car without you, that’s OK, but let them drive in peace, without you talking the whole time next to them.

### Not doing a major service
If your car is due for a major service, don’t think you can hand that off to the car purchaser. It will almost always reduce the value of your car more than if you did the service yourself.

### Not listing the car on a classifieds website
If you’re serious about selling your car, then it’s worth paying the small amount of money to list your car on a classifieds website such as carsales.com.au. Trying to sell to local friends, family or on social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter is difficult, and may not get you the best resale value.
