There’s a lot you can do to ensure you get the best value for money when buying a new or used car.

### Buy a vehicle history report
A history report will tell you whether the car has been reported as stolen, damaged or written off. It also tells you the history of the car including financing and where it has been registered.

### Insure your car before you drive away
Having an accident directly after purchasing a new or used car would be devastating, but it would be even more devastating if you didn’t have insurance.

Some dealers can offer short term insurance, but it is often very expensive. Insurance can easily be purchased online, so be sure to have an idea of which insurer you’re going to use.

Ideally, you would purchase the insurance before picking the car up, or purchase it on your phone/tablet before driving off.

All insurers are required to offer a cooling-off period, so if you buy insurance but don’t end buying the car then you’ll be able to get a full refund.

### Organise inspections during the day
To avoid any marks being hidden, organise your inspections during the day, preferably with good weather.

### Be wary of poorly written ads
Ads with few details or that are poorly written could indicate the seller is trying to hide something or doesn’t want to sell the car. Look for ads that have lots of detail and reveal and minor damage to the car.

### Look for cars with good photos
Photos are the first thing you’ll look at on a car classifieds website listing, so look for photos which are clear and show the car in detail. Listings with few photos or unclear, blurry, or poorly lit photos could be trying to hide something.
