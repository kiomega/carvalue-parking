When it comes to buying a new or used car, there’s various common mistakes that new and experienced buyers make. We list some of them below and ways you can overcome them.

### Not negotiating on price
Don’t fall in love with a car until you own it. If you see a car listed that you really like, don’t think it’s not worth negotiating on price because it might go to someone else.

Most of the time, sellers set the price expecting negotiation. Even if they don’t, it’s worth trying first. How much should you negotiate? That’s an open ended question. For a car that costs around $15,000, you can probably get $500 - $800 off the price. But always remember, it’s better to start high and reduce your expectations as negotiations go on. Increasing the amount you negotiate off the price doesn’t work.

### “The walk out”
If you’re buying from a dealer, you’ve probably heard of a technique called “the walk out” - it’s where you walk out and drive off from the car yard if they don’t accept your price. This technique has mixed opinions, but when it comes down to money, it works. After you take a car for a test drive, the dealer will invite you back to their office to talk about options. This is where you can offer a price. If they don’t accept your price, just leave the dealership. When you took the car for a test drive, they would have taken a photocopy of your driver’s license and asked for your phone number.

If your offer was reasonable, and the dealer was just playing hardball, you’ll get a call within the next few days asking if you can offer a little more money. If it’s not much more, you could accept the offer, or you can stick to your original offer. This is how negotiation works.

If you don’t get a call back within a few days then your offer may have been unreasonable. You should call the dealer and ask what the issue with the amount of money you offered is, and make another offer.

### Giving into emotions
Car dealers have a string of tricks up their sleeve that they use to get you to buy now.

They will tell you how the car has had many leads looking at it recently - a technique that makes you fear you’re missing out.

They’ll also tell you how the price has recently dropped dramatically, to make it look like you’ve come in at the right time to get a good deal.

A more sophisticated technique they use is when you’re in their office presenting an offer, they enter it into their computer. Sometimes their computer will display a message saying the offer is below cost price, and they’ll show you this message. Often this is untrue.

The important take away here is that car dealers will try and get you to feel like the car is going to disappear soon, or there’s a deal that won’t last. These are all games they play, so avoid giving in to them.

### Trusting the seller’s mechanic
If you’re buying a new or used car, you should always get a mechanic you trust to perform an independent inspection of the car. Some sellers may be uneasy about this, but make it clear that it’s the only way you’ll feel comfortable buying the car.

For a few hundred dollars, the mechanic will check the basic mechanics of the car, check common problems with the model car you’re buying, check paint thickness over the entire body of the car (to determine if there’s been any major body work) and more. It’s a small investment to determine if the car is going to last, something a seller will never tell you.

### After sale extras
When you commit to buying a car, you’ll be presented with a whole array of aftersale extras you can purchase. Be wary about buying these, as often you can get them done elsewhere, significantly cheaper.

### Not checking insurance before buying the car
It’s important to check how much a potential car is going to cost in insurance before you make the decision to buy. Some cars have a higher insurance premium, and if you haven’t budgeted for that amount, you could be in a bit of trouble.
