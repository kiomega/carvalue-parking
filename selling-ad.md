There’s a bit of an art to writing a used car ad. Some people get it, others don’t. Follow these tips to help write a good ad.

### Use correct grammar
Nothing looks more unappealing than a poorly written ad. It indicates laziness and that you don’t really care about getting the best value for your car.

Make sure you write properly formed sentences with correct capitalization. If you’re not sure whether you’re using correct grammar, try using an online grammar checker.

### Go into detail, but not too much detail
A two sentence ad is hardly likely to sell your car, just as much as a 10 paragraph essay. Include details on the make, model and variant, and engine and transmission details. Include when it was last serviced and be honest about any damage to the car. It’s better that buyers know about damage upfront than discovering it after an inspection.

### Include a history of the car
Includes details such as where you purchased the car from and how long ago and what type of driving it normally does. Include a brief history of its servicing and disclose whether there’s any major or minor problems with it. It’s better for the buyer to know upfront about any problems as being transparent can avoid disputes later.

### Avoid abbreviations
Avoid using abbreviations or jargon as that can confuse and put off the buyer. If you need to use a technical term, include a short description of what it means.

### Stick to the facts
If you’re selling a Holden, don’t say how much better Holdens are than Fords. You don’t know who will be reading an ad and you don’t want to put anyone off. Stick to facts on the car.
