                <p>Selling a car can be exciting moment. You get to pass on your pre-loved vehicle to someone else, and (hopefully) get the full value of your car in cash.</p>

                <p>But before you sell your car, there’s a few things you should do to ensure you get as much money for it as possible.</p>

                <h3>Car Valuation</h3>
                <p>The first step is to find out an estimate of what your car is worth. This will guide you in future decisions as you’ll have a rough idea of how much you can get for your car.</p>

                <p><i>Remember: the value of your car is the amount of money when a buyer and a seller mutually agree on a price. No more, no less.</i></p>

                <p>Every car is different and has aged differently. No one can tell you exactly what your car is worth - it will take a bit of negotiating to get the price right.</p>
