There’s a lot you can do to increase the resale value of your car. Check out some of them here.

### Clean your car
If you’re selling to a car dealer, get your car professionally cleaned before taking it in. This shows you care about your car and can help increase the offer they give you.

If you’re selling your car privately, give it a clean before anyone comes and inspects the car. There’s nothing more unappealing than turning up to inspect a car, only to see it’s in poor condition.

When you have a buyer, agree to get the car professionally detailed. This helps secure trust in the sale and will leave the buyer feeling positive about their purchase.

### Remove loose items
Remove any loose papers or items from the seats, floors and boot. It looks untidy having loose items in the car, so remove them before meeting a potential buyer to increase your chances of getting an offer.

### Take good photos
When listing your car on a classifieds website, ensure the photos you take are high-resolution, clear, and during the day. Most modern smartphones are capable of taking good quality photos, but if you’re not sure, use a modern digital camera (borrow one if you have to).

If your car lives in a garage, take it out to a park for the photo shoot. Also, clean and polish your car before the photo shoot.

Photos are what will draw potential buyers to the car initially and if they’re dark, unclear or bad quality, your enquiry rate will tremendously suffer.

### Have the logbooks and paperwork ready
You never know when you’ll get an enquiry for your car, so have all the paperwork ready. Buyers will want to see the service history is in order and is up to date.

If the car has multiple keys, have them ready too.

### Inflate the tyres to the correct pressure
You don’t want to potential buyer bouncing around in the car and then deciding not to purchase it, all because you hadn’t inflated the tyres. It’s quick and easy to do, so go do it!

### Don’t smoke in your car
If you’re a smoker, you’ll want to stop smoking in your car before listing it for sale. Nothing puts off a potential buyer than the smell of smoke in the car.

Buy a deodorizer and put it in the car a few weeks before advertising the car. Make sure you remove the deodorizer when you show a potential buyer the car.

### Fix any minor body damage
If your car has any minor body damage, it may be worth getting it fixed. Little bumps and scratches can be fixed relatively cheaply, and it will help increase your resale value. Consider getting your front bumper resprayed if it is quite visibly scratched.

### Top up the windscreen washer reservoir and radiator
Some potential buyers like to check under the hood to see if the car has been well maintained. Topping up the windscreen washer reservoir to the mark and filling up the radiator can help make it look like you’ve been taking good care of the car.

Actually taking care of your car properly is the best way to ensure your car has a good resale value.

### Buy a vehicle history report
A history report will tell you whether the car has been reported as stolen, damaged or written off. It also tells you the history of the car including financing and where it has been registered.

Having this available for any potential buyers is a proactive step in showing them that everything is OK with the car you are selling.
