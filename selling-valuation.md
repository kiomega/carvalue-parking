Getting your car valued is the first step to selling your car. It will provide a guide as to what you can expect from your potential buyers, and enable you to more confidently negotiate with the buyer, whether that be a car salesman or a private buyer.

Luckily, it’s not as hard as it seems. There’s a few ways to go about it, ranging from easy to a little more involved.

### Search for similar cars
Chances are, there’s a car similar in age and condition to yours listed on a car classifieds website. Before you go searching, there’s a few points to keep in mind:
- **Search for cars with similar mileage:** Mileage is one of the biggest factors that affects price. You might find a well-priced car of the same model as yours and start dreaming about the money you’ll receive. Before you get too excited, check that it has a similar mileage.
The average motorist drives around 15,000 - 20,000 kilometres per year.
- **Make sure you’re really searching for the same model car:** You might think you have a 2005 Mitsubishi Magna, but there’s about 8 different variants of 2005 Mitsubishi Magnas. Vehicle manufacturers create different ‘badges’ (not physical badges) of each model car to provide variation and choice between entry level and more sophisticated models. If in doubt, consult the owner’s manual you received when you purchased the car - the exact make, model and badge are usually in the first few pages of the book. If you no longer have the owner’s manual, your local car dealer should be able to tell you for free.
- **Search for cars that have similar wear and tear:** If the paint on your car is dull and faded, you’re not going to get as much money for it as a well-looked after, polished equivalent. When conducting your research, pay close attention to cars that have a similar paint colour and condition, similar interior design, similar condition of the seats and upholstery, and similar condition of the wheels.
- **Search for cars with similar registration expiry dates:** It may seem like a small tweak, but with registration costing close to $1000 these days, it can make or break a few hundred dollars when you sell. Just remember to factor in registration expiry dates searching for similar cars.

### Used car dealer
Used car dealers can also provide an estimate of what your car is worth. If there’s a car you’re interested in buying from a dealer, head to the dealer that is selling the car and ask them to provide you with a free valuation for trade in. Check out our tips and tricks before taking your car to a used car dealer for valuation.

Used car dealers will generally fetch a lower price for your car than if you sold it yourself. The advantage is that a used car dealer will take your car today, whereas if you sell it yourself it may be a while before you get an interested buyer. You have to weigh up the advantages of both.
